### Protecting WIFI against rogue access points

After the WEP handshake, the WPA handshake takes place. Everything before
the WPA handshake cannot be protected by using the WPA key as verification and
protection against a rogue access point.
A PKI, with certificates, could have protected against this. The drawback is that
you have to pre-configure the network which is not nice from a user perspective.
