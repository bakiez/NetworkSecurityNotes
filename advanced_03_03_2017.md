# Cryptography

P: message, K: key, C: cyphertext.

## Key streams

For a key stream: `P xor K = C`, `C xor K = P`, `C xor P = K`.

Historically, keys of more than 40 bits were called 'strong encryption' and 
thus not allowed.

One could thus use either a 32 bit stream (less safe), or use a 64 bit stream
where 24 bits are IV, and 40 bits are the secret key.

When packets can get lost, key streams can get out of sync. A solution is to 
put the IV in the unencrypted header and use that to find out where you are 
and decrypt. *I think*.

Notes for page 16 about PRGA:
assuming the key is completely random:  
p = 1 - (255/256)^256 = 0.63 is the probability, -> 37% that something is not
touched again.

So in the resulting cypher, j1 = k[0], and in the output, there is a probability
of 37% that 



j1 = k[0]  
i = 1  
j2 = (j1 + 1 + k[1]) % 256 = (k[0] + k[1] + 1  ) % 256  
i = 2  
j3 = ([k0] + k[1] + 1 + 2 + k[2]) % 256  

This becomes a series. The estimation for j[t] is:  
`sum(i=0, t) k[i] + sum(i=0, t) i` `t(t+1)/2`
