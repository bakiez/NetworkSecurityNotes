## Switches
RAM is way too slow, that's why we have CAM, which can do lookups in constant
time. However, CAM is very expensive, so switches usually do not have space
for more than 128.000 ARPs.

ARP is ~40 bytes, at a slow connection of 10Mbit/s, you can do about 25.000 ARPs
per second, so you can fill the ARP table within six seconds.

Then when the switch gets a new packet, that address is not in the ARP table
anymore (because you filled it). Then, what to do?
- Discard the package: no data leaks, but data loss instead
- Broadcast the package: no data loss, but data leaks instead.

In case of an empty switch configuration, you cannot discard because then you
would never be able to fill the ARP table. Therefore broadcasting is the way
to go.

What to do against this attack, when it only takes a few seconds?
- Block ARP requests after a certain threshold
- Check ARP bursts

When something is not used for 5 minutes in FIB, it is deleted automatically.

### Port security
Limit the number of devices behind each port.
- Rate limits
- Mac filtering, it is very bad for access control (MAC spoofing) but works
excellently against ARP attacks.
However, doing port filtering between two switches can cause chaos because then
it is normal for there to be tens of thousands of ARP messages.
- Do classification by ports: differentiate between trunk port and access ports.
Depending on the kind of port, do different filtering.

## VLAN 802.1Q
Separates the physical infrastructure into virtually separate LANs.
A device can also be part of multiple memberships, and also when a device is not
a part of a certain membership, you can configure it such that it will also not
receive information for that membership.

Issues:
- Switch spoofing.
    - STP
    - (D)DOS (The CPU has to handle all control messages, so taking down a
    switch with control messages is fairly easy)
    - Countermeasures: limit what can come in.
- Double tagging attack: look into this at home!
    - Root problem: VLAN1 is used when there is no tag, and is also used for
    VLAN1 (if I understand it correctly..).
    - Countermeasures:
        - disallow double tagging
            - problem: When sending something over a VLAN within your network
            going from Rotterdam to Amsterdam, the ISP will add a second VLAN
            tag to separate your traffic from that of your competitor.
        - disallow non-tagged packets: configure the switches to add a tag
        'VLAN $n' when a pc on VLAN $n sends a packet without a tag.
        - disable the unused ports and move to a non-default VLAN id.
- Multiple logical VLANs are still on the same hardware. When one VLAN
misbehaves (e.g. claims all bandwidth) all VLANs notice this. There is still
physical entanglement.

## WIFI 802.11
- __Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS):__  everyone talks to everyone without a
central access point
- __Infrastructure BSS:__ every one talks to everyone through a common central
access point (Service Set IDentification)
- __Extended Service Set:__ multiple access points, such as eduroam at the TU.
These all share the same SSID

The first WIFI standard had a system callend Open System Authentication (OSA),
which is a euphemism, because there is no authentication in an open system.
They already knew that this could not compete with ethernet, because ethernet
has access control by needing a physical cable. Very soon verification was added
with the protocol Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP).

### Problems
#### Autoconnect
__Problem:__ Example for wifi-in-de-trein: when you autoconnect to a certain SSID, an
attacker can broadcast with that SSID. The only thing he has to do to make
you connect to him instead of the real wifi-in-de-trein is to broadcast a
stronger signal. Which obviously is trivial.

__Solutions:__ Rogue access point detection by checking if there are multiple
access points with the same SSID. But what to do when you find one?
- Find out where they are before taking out the torches and the pitch forks.
- Increase own signal power, and try to win this somehow
- Third one is apparently most important, did not understand, see book. Is about
reacting and making sure no further compromises are taking place. See
the MARRIOT TO PAY 600.000 TO RESOLVE WIFI-BLOCKING INVESTIGATION, because
apparently this is the technique.
