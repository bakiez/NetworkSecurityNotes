## Resilient Topology Planning

### Redudancy:
The easy version of redundancy is to just buy a second system.

#### In Theory
Usually the following is not used in practice due to complexity. See slides
at Resilitient Topology Planning.

##### a) Path protection
The problem is, with two complete paths you have double the cost,
and in practice this is really only done when you have something 
important to protect.
Quite resilient in the sence that a full catastrophic failure of 
one path can be survived. Five failures at max may be survived,
but if with two failures still both paths can be cut.

##### b) Segment protection
With a little bit more hardware, more places may fail while still
being able to complete the path.

##### c) Node protection
With dynamic switching, multiple nodes can be protected.

##### d) Link protection

#### In practice

##### a) 1 + 1, one plus one
Send the data twice. This is a configuration where a single outage has no 
influence on the communication whatsoever.

##### b) 1 : 1, one to one
One link that can immediately take over, but because you have to switch links
there still is a small outage.
Why do this and not 1+1? Use the backup line for whatever bulk transmission of
data. If the first line fails, immediately stop transmission over the second
line and put the data of the first one over the second.

##### c) 1 : N, one to N
One backup line for N normal lines.
When more than one line fails, there is a problem: which traffic is most 
important?

##### d) M : N, M to N
M backup line for N normal lines.

#### Logical Redundancy, physical shared risk
